## Project Overview

The backend handles business logic, API routing, database interaction, authentication, and admin functionalities for managing employers, employees, job listings, and user subscriptions (free and paid tiers).

## Features

- **User Management**: Employees and employers can register, authenticate, and manage profiles.
- **Job Listings**: Employers can post, edit, and delete job listings. Employees can search, view, and apply for jobs.
- **KYC Verification**: Admins can verify employers and employees using KYC documents.
- **Subscription Plans**: Paid and free plans for both employees and employers.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Super admin can view and manage users, jobs, and handle KYC approval.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building the API.
- **Firebase/Firestore**: Real-time NoSQL database.
- **Firebase Authentication**: Handles user authentication and authorization.
- **Cloud Functions**: For serverless backend logic.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: For secure authentication.
- **Stripe**: For handling payments (optional, for premium services).
- **Jest and Enzyme**: For unit and integration testing.
- **Firebase Hosting**: Optional for deploying backend services.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blue-collar-job-backend.git
   cd blue-collar-job-backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up Firebase Project:**

   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Create a new project and set up Firestore, Firebase Authentication, and Cloud Functions.
   - Enable email/password authentication in Firebase Authentication.

4. **Configure environment variables:**

   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following keys:

   ```bash
   FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
   FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project_auth_domain
   FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
   FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
   FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_firebase_app_id
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key (if using premium services)
   ```

5. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Configuration

- Firebase services must be configured, including Firestore, Authentication, and optionally, Cloud Functions for the serverless environment.
- JWT is used for handling authentication; ensure the secret key (`JWT_SECRET`) is set in your `.env` file.

npm test
```
